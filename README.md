## Hackers Teaching Hackers General Badge

The general attendee badge for HTH 2019 was a PCB with the necessary contacts and traces to allow for a USB or battery powered SAO (Shitty Add-On) Totem badge.

Included in this repository are the necessary KiCad files for modifying this design and creating the necessary outputs for manufacturing. The gerber files for fabrication
have been included as well for your convenience.

The bill of materials can be observed in the file `hth-gen-bom.csv`. A digikey cart can also be [viewed here](https://www.digikey.com/short/p9q0p7) which contains the necessary components to 'electrify' your badge.


*Note: An error exists in the traces around the switch for the badge. You must bridge the middle pins of the slide switch as seen in the bottom of the picture below.*
